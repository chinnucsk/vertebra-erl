== Deprecated

This library has been deprecated. A new version of the Erlang library is in the
works for the 0.5 or 0.6 release. For those of you using this code, it's going
to remain in the 0.4 line of releases, but we don't recommend that people start
using it at this point.

== Quickstart

To build all of the erlang components just type:

  $ make

To install some default configuration (needed for the integration tests):

  $ make install-config

To build a single project (e.g. herault):

  $ make libs=herault

To launch an application (e.g. herault):

  $ bin/vertebractl herault start

To launch an application in debug mode (e.g. herault):

  $ bin/vertebractl herault live

== Installation

All you should have to do to install is:

  $ make && make install && make install-config
